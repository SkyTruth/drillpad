<a href="http://frack.skytruth.org/frackfinder" target="_blank">FrackFinder</a> is a crowdsourced skytruthing project to find, map and track drilling and fracking (drilling for natural gas using hydraulic fracturing) across the United States.
<p>

<a href="http://SkyTruth.org" target="_blank">SkyTruth</a> is using satellite and aerial imagery to identify fracking sites, track activity on those sites, and map the extent of the visible surface impact from every frack site we can see.
<p>

Crowdsourcing helps us create brand new data on fracking while providing contributors (that's you!) a new perspective on the issues through participating in the mapping process.
