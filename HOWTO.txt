CREATING TASKS  
Spuds from 2005-2010 were combined and broken into counties. they are located in C:\Users\Yolandita\Documents\Well Pad App\site info\sites-spuds_by_county
Take desired spuds and put into Cygwin folder with chopper. Copy the corresponding county sid into the same folder. Edit chopper.py to reflect pieces in folder then run in Cygwin.
	
	$ cd newworkingfolder
	$ python chopper.py

		(one county at a time. for multiple counties, copy and past all the images_names.csv into a new csv before chopping next county and then paste 		them all back together.) 

UPLOADING TASKS
In S3 open drillpadcat/data/TitasTest/testimages and click upload in ACTIONS dropdown. In upload window click ADD FILES, add all of the PNGs ONLY that were created by chopper. Then click SET DETAILS and continue editing details. Set permissions to public and set metadata as follows: key: content-type. value: image/png.

RETRIEVE RESULTS

	$ cd
	$ cd pybossa_tools
	$ python export_task_runs.py drillpadtestapp
Three csv's will be produced in the C:\cygwin\home\Yolandita\pybossa_tools   : results.csv, full_results.csv, county_results.csv

GET RESULTS INTO PROGRESS MAP
In google drive, create a new fusion table from the county_results.csv. Go to previously made fusion table with all county kmls and merge with county_results.csv
set the map to show counties with no data a different color. (maybe remove counties that don't have any sites to begin with). and then set colors for percent complete (different color for 100%)
