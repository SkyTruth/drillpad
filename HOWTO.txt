CREATING TASKS  

	Spuds from 2005-2010 were combined and broken into counties. they are located in C:\Users\Yolandita\Documents\Well Pad App\site info\sites-spuds_by_county
	Take desired spuds and put into Cygwin folder with chopper. Copy the corresponding county sid into the same folder. Edit chopper.py to reflect pieces in folder then run in Cygwin.
	
	$ cd newworkingfolder
	$ python chopper.py

		(one county at a time. for multiple counties, copy and past all the images_names.csv into a new csv before chopping next county and then paste 		them all back together.)
