  <p>FrackFinder Ohio - Well Pad Mapper: This <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/skytruthing" target="_blank">#skytruthing</a> project combines state drilling permit data and high-resolution aerial images to document which well pads are active in Ohio's Utica and Marcellus Shale. All you need to do is tell us if you see evidence of drilling activity at each site we show you.</p>
